 its important to protect yourse;f online because your information can be accessed by anyone. you could get your identity stolen. robbed, sometimes even kidnapped. you can make sure the sites you use are trust worthy and you dont share any personal information. you can work with others by using apps that are made for socializing and not giving them your number. you can make private accounts or even only share yours socials with people you know and trust.

a current event is the elections. people are upset and arguing over it. soome people dont like trump some dont like kamala and some dont like either. people are posting hate, threats, etc. social media and electronic devices arent exactly helping right now in this moment.

I think technology makes it easier to order food and see whats available where. if you are cooking thanksgiving diner and forget something you dont have all day to look for what you need so you can go online and find out where that item is. you can also do all your holiday shopping online instead of going out. when you go in person you have to go store to store, spending gas money and your time. when you buy online you can do it from anywhere. At work, school, in bed, the library, on a flight and more. you can alao find more online and buy things from outside the country.
